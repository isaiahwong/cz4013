# Running the Server
The flight data is retrieved from a `flights.csv` data file which is generated from the `scripts/seed_gen.py` file.

## Running with golang
```
$ make
# or
$ go run cmd/main.go -deadline 3 -semantic 1 -loss 0 -port 8080
```

## Running with docker
```
$ docker build  -t flight-sys .
$ docker run -p 8080:8080/udp flight-sys 
```

## Running with prebuilt binaries
```
$ ./release/flightsystem-macos -deadline 3 -semantic 1 -loss 0 -port 8080
$ ./release/flightsystem-ubuntu -deadline 3 -semantic 1 -loss 0 -port 8080
```

# Running the client and interactive mode
> Interactive mode enables configuring the server/client without flags
## Running with golang
```
# Running client
$ go run cmd/main.go -c

# Running interactive mode
$ ./release/flightsystem-macos -c
```
## Running in interactive mode
```
# Running client
$ go run cmd/main.go -i

# Running interactive mode
$ ./release/flightsystem-macos -i
```

| loss     | The serverâ€™s loss rate in percentage where it drops the packet. (For simulation).  |
| port     | The port where the server will expose its endpoint.                                |
